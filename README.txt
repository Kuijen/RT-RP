Steps to install and run it:

1. Make sure that Developer Mode is enabled and that the USB Debugging prompt inside the headset is accepted!

2. Connect your headset to your computer and run RTRP, a command prompt should pop-up and it should say "Performing Streamed Install", after that you should get a window pop-up on your headset asking for permission, press accept.

3. You can change which apps are allowed to launch by changing true to false and vice versa in "RT-RP Config.txt" inside your Documents folder, you can also change their install directories in the same file.

4. Using HEVC/HEVC 10-Bit and possibly AV1 is recommended for PCVR Streaming to avoid stutters.

5. Disabling unneeded launch options does speed up the script ever so slightly.

6. you can change the settings and launch options inside (Documents > "RT-RP Config.ini") E.g changing "Launch_SteamVR" from "false" to "true" and vice versa will enable or disable that app from being launched.
You can also change the .exe paths for programs in the same text file, make use there are no spaces.
Lastly there are some miscellaneous settings like "High_Prioriority"
